Crono is a time-based background job scheduler daemon (just like Cron) for Ruby on Rails. It's pure Ruby. It doesn't use Unix Cron and other platform-dependent things. So you can use it everywhere.


## Requirements

Tested with latest MRI Ruby (2.2, 2.1 and 2.0) and Rails 3.2+  
Other versions are untested but might work fine.


## Installation

Add the following line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'crono'

Run the bundle command to install it.  
After you install Crono, you can run the generator:

    rails generate crono:install

It will create a configuration file `config/cronotab.rb`  
Now you are ready to move forward to create a job and schedule it.


## Usage

#### Create Job

Crono can use Active Job jobs from `app/jobs/`. The only requirements is that the `perform` method should take no arguments.

Here's an example of a test job:
app/jobs/test_job.rb

    class TestJob < ActiveJob::Base
      def perform
        # put you scheduled code here
        # Comments.deleted.clean_up...
      end
    end

The ActiveJob jobs is convenient because you can use one job in both periodic and enqueued ways. But Active Job is not required. Any class can be used as a crono job if it implements a method `perform` without arguments:

    class TestJob # This is not an Active Job job, but pretty legal Crono job.
      def perform
        # put you scheduled code here
        # Comments.deleted.clean_up...
      end
    end


#### Job Schedule

The schedule described in the configuration file `config/cronotab.rb`, that created using `crono:install` or manually. The semantic is pretty straightforward:

    Crono.perform(TestJob).every 2.days, at: "15:30"

You can schedule one job a few times, if you want a job to be performed a few times a day:

    Crono.perform(TestJob).every 1.day, at: "00:00"
    Crono.perform(TestJob).every 1.day, at: "12:00"

The `at` can be a Hash:

    Crono.perform(TestJob).every 1.day, at: {hour: 12, min: 15}


#### Run daemon

To run Crono daemon, in your Rails project root directory:

    bundle exec crono RAILS_ENV=development

crono usage:
```
Usage: crono [options]
    -C, --cronotab PATH              Path to cronotab file (Default: config/cronotab.rb)
    -L, --logfile PATH               Path to writable logfile (Default: log/crono.log)
    -P, --pidfile PATH               Path to pidfile (Default: tmp/pids/crono.pid)
    -d, --[no-]daemonize             Daemonize process (Default: false)
```
